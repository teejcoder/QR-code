## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Working on this project helped reinforce my understanding of responsive design and CSS Flexbox. I learned how to structure a simple yet effective component using semantic HTML5 and how to apply flexbox for layout management. Here are some code snippets I'm proud of:

```html
<h1>Some code I'm proud of</h1>

  <div class="hero">
    <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" />
      <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
      <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level!</p>
    </div>
  </div>
```
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
    img {
        width: 400px;
    }
    .hero {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100vh;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue improving my CSS Grid and Flexbox skills. Additionally, I plan to deepen my understanding of responsive design patterns and best practices. I also aim to explore more advanced CSS techniques and JavaScript frameworks to enhance the interactivity and functionality of my projects.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - The MDN documentation is an excellent resource for understanding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helped me clarify a lot of concepts while working on this project.
- [Example resource 2](https://css-tricks.com/) - This website has numerous articles and tutorials on various CSS techniques and best practices. I found the guides on Flexbox and Grid particularly useful.
